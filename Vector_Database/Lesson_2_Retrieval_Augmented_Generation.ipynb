Once you've done an initial run, consider increasing this value to 750 or 1,000. You'll likely notice that the context provided to the LLM becomes richer and better.

      "Captain Cook saw the Aboriginal people with their simple way of life. He saw them fishing and hunting and collecting grass seeds and fruit. But there were no houses and no fences. In most parts of the world, people put up a house and a fence or some marker to show that they own the land. But the Aboriginal people did not own the land in that way. They belonged to the land, like a baby belongs to its mother. Captain Cook went home to England and told the government that no-one owned the land. This would later cause a terrible problem for the Aboriginal people.\n",

      "In the 1700s, in England, laws were tough, many people were poor and gaols (jails) were full. A person could be sentenced to death for stealing a loaf of bread. Many people were hanged for small crimes. But usually they were just thrown in gaol. Often they were sent away to the British colonies in America. But by the 1770s, the colonies in America became the United States. They were free from British rule and would not take England's convicts any more, so England needed to find a new and less populated place.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the 1780s the gaols of England were so full that convicts were often chained up in rotting old ships. The government decided to make a settlement in New South Wales and send some of the convicts there. In 1788 the First Fleet of eleven ships set sail from Portsmouth carrying convicts, sailors, marines, a few free settlers and enough food to last for two years. Their leader was Captain Arthur Phillip. They were to make a new colony at the place that Captain Cook had discovered, named Botany Bay because of all the unknown plants found there by the two scientists.\n",

The first Australian Oscar was won by 1942's Kokoda Front Line!, directed by Ken G. Hall. In the 1970s and 1980s lots of big Australian movies and movie stars became world famous with movies like Picnic at Hanging Rock, Gallipoli (with Mel Gibson), The Man From Snowy River and Crocodile Dundee. Russell Crowe, Cate Blanchett and Heath Ledger became global stars during the 1990s and Australia starring Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman made a lot of money in 2008.\n",

      "Captain Cook saw the Aboriginal people with their simple way of life. He saw them fishing and hunting and collecting grass seeds and fruit. But there were no houses and no fences. In most parts of the world, people put up a house and a fence or some marker to show that they own the land. But the Aboriginal people did not own the land in that way. They belonged to the land, like a baby belongs to its mother. Captain Cook went home to England and told the government that no-one owned the land. This would later cause a terrible problem for the Aboriginal people.\n",

      "In the 1700s, in England, laws were tough, many people were poor and gaols (jails) were full. A person could be sentenced to death for stealing a loaf of bread. Many people were hanged for small crimes. But usually they were just thrown in gaol. Often they were sent away to the British colonies in America. But by the 1770s, the colonies in America became the United States. They were free from British rule and would not take England's convicts any more, so England needed to find a new and less populated place.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the 1780s the gaols of England were so full that convicts were often chained up in rotting old ships. The government decided to make a settlement in New South Wales and send some of the convicts there. In 1788 the First Fleet of eleven ships set sail from Portsmouth carrying convicts, sailors, marines, a few free settlers and enough food to last for two years. Their leader was Captain Arthur Phillip. They were to make a new colony at the place that Captain Cook had discovered, named Botany Bay because of all the unknown plants found there by the two scientists.\n",

      "Cricket is a popular sport that originated in England and has since spread to many countries around the world, including Australia. It is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each on a large oval-shaped field. The objective of the game is for one team to score more runs than the other team while the other team tries to get all of the opposing players out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The game is played with a hard leather ball and a wooden bat. The batting team takes turns sending two players, known as batsmen, onto the field to face the bowling of the opposing team. The bowler, who is a member of the fielding team, throws or bowls the ball towards the batsman, who attempts to hit the ball with their bat and score runs by running between two sets of three wooden stumps, called wickets, at either end of the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fielding team tries to get the batsmen out by hitting the wickets with the ball, catching the ball before it touches the ground, or running out the batsman while they are attempting to score runs. Once ten of the eleven batsmen are out, the teams switch roles and the fielding team becomes the batting team.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cricket matches can last anywhere from a few hours to several days, depending on the format of the game. The most popular format is called Test cricket, which is played over five days and is considered the ultimate test of skill and endurance for players. Other formats include One Day Internationals, which are limited to 50 overs per team, and Twenty20, which is a shorter and more fast-paced version of the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cricket is a highly strategic and technical sport, requiring players to have a combination of physical skill, mental focus, and teamwork. It is also a sport that is deeply ingrained in the culture of many countries, with passionate fans and intense rivalries between teams. Some of the most famous cricket players in history include Sir Donald Bradman from Australia, Sachin Tendulkar from India, and Brian Lara from the West Indies.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Australia, cricket is a beloved national sport and has a rich history dating back to the 1800s. The country has produced many successful cricket teams and players, and the sport continues to be a source of pride and entertainment for Australians. Whether you are a seasoned fan or new to the game, cricket is a thrilling and engaging sport that is sure to captivate audiences for years to come.\n"
